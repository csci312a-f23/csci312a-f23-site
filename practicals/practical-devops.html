<p>
<strong>Initial Due Date: 2023-03-16 8:15AM</strong> <br />

<strong>Final Due Date: 2023-04-07 4:15PM</strong>

</p>

<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Practice integration via GitHub pull request (PR)</li>
  <li>Use a CI server (Github Actions) to test a PR before integration</li>
  <li>Deploy an application to a PaaS (fly.io)</li>
</ul>

<p>Today you will add a feature to the color picker to enable the user to enter the color component by number. As part of that process we will practice testing, CI and automated deployment. Check out a deployed version of the final result.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create the git repository for your practical by <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/7fptJ19E">accepting the assignment from GitHub Classroom</a>. This will create a new repository for you with a skeleton application already setup for you.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository to you computer with <code>üíª git clone</code> (get the name of the repository from GitHub).</li>
  <li>Open up the <code>package.json</code> file and add your name as the author of the package.</li>
  <li>Install the module dependencies by executing <code>üíª npm install</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="add-ci-with-github-actions">Add CI with Github Actions</h2>

<p>Before you make any changes, create a feature branch named ‚Äúeditable-number‚Äù to isolate your modifications from the main branch:</p>

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">üíª git checkout -b editable-number
</code></pre>

<p>This should be the new default action that you take when working on your code to get you in the habit. When you start a feature, create a corresponding feature branch. Work until it is stable and only then merge it into the main branch.</p>

<h3 id="create-the-ci-config-file">Create the CI config file</h3>

<p>GitHub actions allow us to execute a wide variety of actions in response to git events. If you are looking at the repository on Github, you will see there is an Actions tab, which will allow you to add a number of different actions designed by GitHub and the community. However, all these do is create a special configuration file in your repository, so we will do that directly.</p>

<p>At the top level of your package directory, you should have a <code>.github</code> directory with a workflows directory inside (if not, you should create them). Inside of workflows, create a new file called <code>node.js.yml</code> (the important part of the file name is the .yml on the end, but use the full name) with the contents shown below.</p>

<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> (pronounced like ‚Äúcamel‚Äù) is a popular file format for text-based configuration files. It won‚Äôt be important to understand all of its ins and outs, for now the key thing to know is that like Python, indentation matters.</p>

<div class="code-header">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-clipboard" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" data-bs-original-title="Copy to clipboard">Copy</button>
</div>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18.x
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm test
</code></pre>

<p>There are two main sections here: <code>on</code> and <code>jobs</code>. The <code>on</code> section tells GitHub Actions when to execute this action (when we push to main or make a PR to main). The <code>jobs</code> section describes the steps to carry out. In this case, it</p>
<ol>
  <li>Checks out our code into a linux virtual machine</li>
  <li>Installs node 18</li>
  <li>Runs <code>npm ci</code>, which uses the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to install all of the dependencies</li>
  <li>Runs <code>npm test</code></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-a-status-badge-to-your-readmemd">Add a status badge to your README.md</h3>

<p>As you browse different repositories on GitHub, you may have seen flashy status badges in the README files that indicate that the tests are passing (or not). You can add one to your project as well.</p>

<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge#using-the-workflow-file-name">documentation</a>, the URL of the image is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">https://github.com/&lt;OWNER&gt;/&lt;REPOSITORY&gt;/actions/workflows/&lt;WORKFLOW_FILE&gt;/badge.svg
</code></pre>

<p>We need to put this into Markdown syntax to add an image. So for example, I might use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-md">![workflow status](https://github.com/csci312a-s23/practical06-devops-mlinderm/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="create-a-pr">Create a PR</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs commit this change and push it to GitHub:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">üíª git add .
üíª git commit -m "Add actions config file"
üíª git push -u origin editable-number
</code></pre>

<p>The last line tells the remote repository (origin) that we would like to create a new branch called editable-number, and connects the two for us.</p>

<p>Visit the repository on GitHub. There should be a yellow banner across the top notifying you of a change to a branch and asking if you would like to ‚ÄúCompare &amp; pull request‚Äù. Do so. <em>If you don‚Äôt see the banner, you can always create a new PR from the ‚ÄòPull requests‚Äô tab.</em></p>

<p>On the new page that comes up you will see a form for starting the PR. Type in a message and click the button to create the PR.</p>

<p>You will see a message that it is OK to merge with main. This is unsurprising since no one has done anything to main since you made a branch, so the merge just involved adding the changes in this branch on top of main. If you wait a moment, however, you will see a new message appear as GitHub Actions kicks off (there will be two: one from the classroom auto-grader and the one you just added). Give it a moment to run, and then it should come back and tell you that the checks have failed. This is also unsurprising since you haven‚Äôt changed the code yet. If you click on Details you can see the run log and the output from running the tests.</p>

<h2 id="enhancing-the-color-picker-with-controllable-number">Enhancing the color picker with controllable number</h2>

<p>Now let‚Äôs make our change the the ColorPicker.</p>

<p>Start the development server (<code>üíª npm run dev</code>) so you can see the effects of your changes. You should see the familiar ColorPicker appear in the web view. You can also run the tests with <code>üíª npm test</code>, and they should fail.</p>

<p>You are now ready to make the changes to the <code>LabeledSlider</code>. The change is very simple, you are going to remove the current <code>span</code> which reports the value (<code>&lt;span&gt;{value}&lt;/span&gt;</code>) and replace it with a 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number">number</a>
input element. The numerical input will be very similar to its slider counterpart. Its value should be controlled by the React state (so that all the elements that depend on or modify that value remain in sync), it should update the color component as specified, and have appropriate <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> values. The difference is it will be of type ‚Äúnumber‚Äù.</p>

<p>You should see your new inputs at the end of the sliders, and the tests should all pass.</p>

<h3 id="revisit-the-pr">Revisit the PR</h3>

<p>Now that you have working code, add, commit and push it with git.</p>

<p>Return to the PR page on GitHub and after a moment you should see the action kick off again. This time you should get a message that ‚ÄúAll checks have passed‚Äù. If not, make sure that the tests were passing locally and that the new code has actually been pushed to the branch.</p>

<p>Click the ‚ÄúMerge pull request‚Äù button. it should give you a chance to add a message to the merge and then you can click ‚ÄúConfirm merge‚Äù.</p>

<p>After the merge is complete, it will give you a ‚ÄúDelete branch‚Äù button. Click it to remove the feature branch from GitHub.</p>

<h3 id="clean-up-your-local-repository-after-the-merge">Clean up your local repository after the merge</h3>

<p>Return to your terminal and switch back to the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch (<code>üíª git checkout main</code>). You are going to want to pull the changes from GitHub, pruning to delete remote tracking references and then delete your local branch (<code>üíª git pull --prune</code>).</p>

<p><em>To avoid mistakes when deleting branches, you can add the <code>--dry-run</code> option to the <code>pull --prune</code> command , e.g. <code>üíª git pull --prune --dry-run</code> to double check before actually pruning anything (note you will still need to run the actual command when you are sure it correct).</em></p>

<p>The full command sequence is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">üíª git checkout main
üíª git pull --prune
üíª git branch -d editable-number
</code></pre>

<h2 id="deploy-to-fly">Deploy to Fly</h2>

<p>We are going to use the <a href="https://fly.io">Fly.io</a> to deploy our applications. You should have already received an invitation to the ‚Äúcsci312a-s23‚Äù organization (via your Middlebury e-mail). The shared organization will enable us to all work under an account the department pays for. <em>Note, Fly.io e-mails seem to end up in quarantine. If you don‚Äôt see an invitation, check your junk mail folder and any <a href="https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine">quarantined messages</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by downloading the <code>flyctl</code> tool for your system from <a href="https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/">here</a></li>
  <li>If you already have an account sign in, if not, sign up for a free account. <em>You should have already been invited to the csci312a-s23 organization and so should not need to enter a credit card to launch applications under that organization.</em></li>
  <li>Once you have signed up or signed in, you can prepare to deploy your application with <code>üíª flyctl launch</code>. You should generally choose the default options for the subsequent questions, with a location near us, and the ‚Äúcsci312a-s23‚Äù organization but do <em>not</em> choose to deploy right now.</li>
  <li>The <code>launch</code> command will have created several files for you: <code>Dockerfile</code> (and corresponding <code>.dockerignore</code>) and <code>fly.toml</code>. We will need to edit the <code>Dockerfile</code> for our application. Specifically:
    <ol>
      <li>One lines 2 change <code>FROM node:16-alpine AS builder</code> to <code>FROM node:18-alpine AS builder</code> and on line 25 change <code>FROM node:16-alpine AS runner</code> to <code>FROM node:18-alpine AS runner</code>. This ensures we are using the same Node version on Fly.io as we are using locally.</li>
      <li>In multiple locations you will find commands for the <code>yarn</code> package manager. Comment those out and uncomment the corresponding lines for using <code>npm</code> (included in the file). We are using <code>npm</code> not <code>yarn</code>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You are now ready to deploy your application by executing <code>üíª flyctl deploy</code>.</li>
  <li>When the deployment is complete execute <code>üíª flyctl open</code> to use your application!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>

<p>Commit any additional changes you may have made (don‚Äôt forget the newly created <code>fly.toml</code>, <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>.dockerignore</code> files, and then push your changes to GitHub. You should then submit your repository to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Required functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Numeric input for ColorPicker</li>
