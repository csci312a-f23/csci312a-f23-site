<strong>Final Due Date: 2023-11-03 4:15PM</strong>

</p>

<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to incorporate REST server interaction into your app</li>
  <li>Practice ‚Äúagile‚Äù development when requirements change over time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This assignment builds on the work of assignment 3. As such, you should not start it until you have <strong>passed all of the tests for assignment 3</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the GitHub classroom <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/QXsbeeE8">link</a> and then clone the repository GitHub classroom creates to your local computer (in your shell, execute <code>üíª git clone</code> followed by the address of the repository).</li>
  <li>Update the <code>package.json</code> file with your name and e-mail</li>
  <li>Install the package dependencies with <code>üíª npm install</code></li>
  <li>Practice good software development habits and create a new feature branch for your work</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have the dependencies installed you can start the development server with <code>üíª npm run dev</code>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>This assignment builds on the <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/practicals/practical-fetch.html">the REST practical</a> in which you incorporated an API into the color picker. You will be transitioning Simplepedia over to server-maintained data management.</p>

<h3 id="the-server">The server</h3>

<p>You will be communicating with a server integrated into your application with NextJS <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction">API routes</a>. The server is already implemented for you. Check out the files in the <code>src/pages/api</code> directory. (Note that this may not be the way you would implement this type of site with Next.JS. In subsequent classes we will talk about other methods for implementing server functionality within Next.JS.)</p>

<p>The server provides the following API (<code>:id</code> indicates a parameter that should be replaced with a valid article id, while <code>:section</code> indicates a parameter that should be replaced with a valid section):</p>

<table class="table table-sm table-bordered table-auto">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Endpoint</th>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/sections</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Fetch a JSON array of all sections in alphabetical order</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Fetch the entire article collection as an array</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles?section=<em>:section</em></td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Fetch all articles in the corresponding section</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles?section=<em>:section</em>&amp;titlesOnly</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Fetch all articles (but id and title fields only) in the corresponding section</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles</td>
      <td>POST</td>
      <td>Add a new article to the collection (the new article should be provided as the JSON-encoded request body)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles/<em>:id</em></td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Get article with <code>id</code> of <em>:id</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/api/articles/<em>:id</em></td>
      <td>PUT</td>
      <td>Update the article with <code>id</code> of <em>:id</em> (entire updated article, including <code>id</code> should be provided as the JSON-encoded request body)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In the case of both PUT and POST, the server will send back the new or updated article.</p>

<p>The server implements some server-side validations and will respond with an error (HTTP status code 4** or 5**) if your request or data is ill-formed or otherwise invalid. An example of the former is a missing or mismatched <code>id</code> field in PUT request body (it should match the URL). An example of the latter is creating an article with a duplicate title. I suggest keeping the browser developer tools open while working on the assignment to monitor your requests and the corresponding responses. Your application should handle errors ‚Äúgracefully‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúcatch‚Äù any errors that arise in your promise chain and not make any state updates if a fetch returns an error code (which manifests as a rejected Promise).</p>

<p>The server is using a local database, implemented with SQLite, for storing the articles during both development and testing. As a result the articles should persist during development.</p>

<h3 id="end-to-end-testing">End-to-end testing</h3>

<p>To enable end-to-end testing, we are running the embedded API server during testing. You will notice your <code>package.json</code> file has a slightly different test command (which builds the production version of your application then starts the server and runs the tests). This testing approach may not be appropriate for other applications, but here it enables us to test our front-end application without needing to mock <code>fetch</code> (like we did in the practical) or create a fake server.</p>

<p>This approach does introduce some limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot run the development server and the tests at the same time as they use the same port</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<h3 id="part-0-port-over-assignment-3-and-prepare-the-database">Part 0: Port over Assignment 3 and prepare the database</h3>

<p>Update the Assignment 4 skeleton with the code you wrote for assignment 3. Be a little cautious as you do this, there are some changes and you don‚Äôt want to just replace the files with your old ones. Some specific notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>collection</code> has been removed from the main component (<code>_app.js</code>) and its children in anticipation of fetching the data from the server. <em>Note that due to this changes not all of our previous code will work until more of the refactoring is complete</em></li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt forget to copy the <code>next.config.js</code> file in your made in assignment 3 (that redirects root requests to <code>/articles</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>To prepare the database for use, execute the following. You can recreate the database at any time by re-running these commands.</p>

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">üíª npx knex migrate:latest
üíª npx knex seed:run
</code></pre>

<h3 id="part-1-refactoring-indexbar">Part 1: Refactoring <code>IndexBar</code></h3>

<p>I suggest tackling this one piece at a time. So, start with displaying the correct sections with database fetched data. Then turn to the titles. Note that the tests assume that the<code>fetch</code>es will occur in <code>IndexBar</code>, not in its child components.</p>

<h4 id="sections">Sections</h4>

<p>Instead of obtaining the sections from the articles in the collection, we will obtain them from the server (that way we don‚Äôt need to have all the articles available locally). Since the sections are no longer derived from the collection we will need to create a piece of state, e.g, <code>sections</code>, to store that information. Start by creating the <code>sections</code> state (initialized with an empty array) and then implementing a <code>useEffect</code> hook that will populate that state with data fetched from the server. Since we only want this hook to execute once, when component first mounts, set the dependencies to be the empty array. Your newly created state can then be passed as the <code>sections</code> prop to the <code>SectionsView</code> component.</p>

<h4 id="titles">Titles</h4>

<p>We similarly refactor the input to the <code>TitlesView</code> component. Instead of filtering articles from <code>collection</code>, we will obtain only the ids and titles of articles that belong to the relevant section from the server. That is, for efficiency reasons we only want to fetch the information we need, the article ids and titles. Notice that the API query parameters described above enable you to efficiently fetch just the data you need. As with the sections, we will need to create a new piece of state, e.g., <code>titles</code>, to store these articles. Start by creating the state, and then implementing another <code>useEffect</code> hook that will fetch the data from the server. Pay close attention to the dependencies of your hook. When will you want to perform a new fetch operation?</p>

<p>With this refactoring complete, you should be able to display sections and their corresponding titles using only data obtained from the server. Note that because <code>TitlesView</code> will be receiving ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù articles, you will likely need to refactor is PropTypes to allow for that. Instead of an array of full <code>ArticleShape</code>s, it will now receive an array of the following (i.e., objects with just <code>id</code><code> and </code>title`` properties).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">PropTypes.shape({
   id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
   title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
})
</code></pre>

<h3 id="part-2-refactoring-mainapp">Part 2: Refactoring <code>MainApp</code></h3>

<p>When we had all the data available, we could make <code>currentArticle</code> a variable, as opposed to a piece of state. Now we will need state to maintain that information over time. Replace your <code>currentArticle</code> variable with <code>currentArticle</code> state (you will likely need to rename your existing <code>setCurrentArticle</code> callback function to something else to avoid naming conflicts with the state setter). With that state in place, create a <code>useEffect</code> hook that will set the <code>currentArticle</code> state based on the current value for <code>id</code> (as extracted from the <code>query</code> object in the router). When <code>id</code> is not defined, we want to clear the current article. When <code>id</code> is defined we want to fetch the corresponding article (and that article alone) from the server.</p>

<p>To try to reduce the number of article requests, we will only fetch an article when it is not already available locally. That is we want to fetch the article when <code>id</code> is defined, and either <code>currentArticle</code> is not defined or <code>id</code> from the router (from the URL) doesn‚Äôt match <code>currentArticle.id</code> (i.e., we have picked a different article). This implies that <code>currentArticle</code> will need to be dependency of your <code>useEffect</code> hook. To ensure that we always get the most up-to-date article, whenever we are switching articles we want to clear the <code>currentArticle</code> so that we fetch the latest version of the article from the server (e.g., if we just created or edited the article). <em>Note it would be even more efficient to use a complete article if available locally, but for simplicity we will not try to implement that optimization as part of this assignment (i.e., we will just re-fetch any newly created or modified articles).</em></p>

<p>Recall that depending on the route <code>router.query.id</code> might be a string containing a single integer, an array of one element or undefined. To most effectively utilize <code>useEffect</code>‚Äôs dependency tracking, we want to normalize the the value of <code>id</code> outside of the <code>useEffect</code> hook, i.e., in the component function body, so that when <code>id</code> switches from <code>"42"</code> to <code>["42"]</code> (or vice versa), we don‚Äôt trigger updates. That is we will use the now normalized integer as the hook dependency. Observe that the unary <code>+</code> operator will convert strings and arrays of strings to integers, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>&gt; +"42"
42
&gt; +["42"]
42
</code></pre>

<h3 id="part-3-refactoring-simplepediacreator-and-simplepediaeditor">Part 3: Refactoring <code>SimplepediaCreator</code> and <code>SimplepediaEditor</code></h3>

<p>These two components differ in their implementation of their callback methods. Update the callbacks to create or update an article by making the appropriate requests to the server (POST to ‚Äú/articles‚Äù to create a new article, PUT to ‚Äú/articles/:id‚Äù to update an article).</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"><code>fetch</code></a> takes a second argument that specializes the behavior of <code>fetch</code>. With that argument we will want to specify the method, the body, and any headers. For example the following specifies a POST request, with JSON encoded data that is expecting a JSON response. Note that we need to manually encode the JavaScript objects as JSON with <code>JSON.stringify</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">fetch(`/url`, {
   method: "POST",
   body: JSON.stringify(data),
   headers: new Headers({
      Accept: "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
   }),
});
</code></pre>

<p>The server is responsible for assigning a unique <code>id</code> to each article (that is the only way to ensure the ids are unique). The POST request will send back the newly created article with its id.</p>

<p>You do not need to integrate the returned article into the titles or other state. Instead when the <code>Simplepedia</code> component and its children are remounted after editing, they will fetch updated sections, the titles in that section, etc. <em>Similar to the note above, we could imagine several possible optimizations to reduce the the amount of data fetched. For simplicity, we will not try to implement those optimizations as part of this assignment.</em></p>

<p>Unlike previous assignments, the server enforces constraints on the articles, specifically, that the titles must be unique. It will rejects POST and PUT requests with a duplicate title. <em>You are not expected to handle these errors.</em> Those constraints may impact your development approach, e.g., you can‚Äôt try adding an article with the title ‚ÄúTest‚Äù twice.</p>

<h3 id="part-4-handling-an-article-with-a-new-section">Part 4: Handling an article with a new section</h3>

<p>We are not attempting to keep our view of Simplepedia up-to-date in real time, i.e., we would not automatically update our sections if another user added an article to a shared server (we would need a slightly different approach). One situation we do want to handle is when we attempt to render an article in a section we didn‚Äôt previously know about.</p>

<p>To handle this situation create a new boolean variable in the body of <code>IndexBar</code> function that is true when the sections should should be updated. That would occur when the current sections are empty or when then current section is defined but not present in the array of known sections. Add that new variable as a dependency to your <code>useEffect</code> hook for updating the sections to ensure you re-fetch the sections when try to view an article that is not in one of the currently known sections.</p>

<p>As above, we create the boolean variable in the component function body to avoid passing an array as a <code>useEffect</code> dependency (which can be tricky and trigger undesired updates). To ensure a truthy or falsy value is converted to a boolean, you can precede it with <code>!!</code>, e.g., <code>!!currentSection</code>. The first <code>!</code> negates the value creating a boolean and the second <code>!</code> reverses the negation.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>

<p>Your submission should not have ESLint warnings or errors when run with <code>üíª npm run lint</code>. Remember than you can fix many errors automatically with <code>üíª npm run lint -- --fix</code> (although since ESLint can sometimes introduce errors during this process, we suggest committing your code before running ‚Äúfix‚Äù so you can rollback any changes). The assignment skeleton includes the Prettier package and associated hooks to automatically reformat your code to a consistent standard when you commit. Thus do not be surprised if your code looks slightly different after a commit.</p>

<p>Submit your assignment by pushing all of your committed changes to the GitHub classroom via <code>üíª git push --all origin</code> and then submitting your repository to Gradescope as described <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/assign/gradescope.html">here</a>. You can submit (push to GitHub and submit to Gradescope) multiple times.</p>

<p>Portions of your assignment will undergo automated grading. Make sure to follow the specifications exactly, otherwise the tests will fail (even if your code generally works as intended). Use the provided test suite (run with <code>üíª npm test</code>) to get immediate feedback on whether your code follows the specification. Because of the increased complexity of a React application, Gradescope can take minutes to run all of the tests. Thus you will be more efficient testing locally and only submitting to Gradescope when you are confident your application meets the specification.</p>
