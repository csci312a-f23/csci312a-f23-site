<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p><em>Please read through the entire set of Getting Started instructions first, before performing any of the steps! Follow the instructions very closely, the setup is different from how we handle individual assignments.</em></p>

<h4 id="as-an-individual-you-will-need-to">As an individual, you will need to:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click through the GitHub Classroom <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/_ESpUzJB">link</a>.</p>

    <p>Unlike past assignments, this is a “Group” assignment in GitHub classroom. When you click through you will be presented with the option to join an existing team or create a new one (unfortunately we can’t initialize the teams automatically). Select your team if it already exists, or if not, please create it. <strong>Please use the names (VT mountains) I specified if you are creating a team</strong>. Note that these names are just for organizational purposes, they do not have anything to do with what you ultimately choose to call your application.</p>

    <p><strong>Everyone needs to click through!</strong> Doing so will add you to the corresponding GitHub team, giving you access to your team’s repository. <strong>Changing GitHub classroom teams seems to be a open issue, so please be careful at this step.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a>, and the different roles, meetings and artifacts that make up the Scrum process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start thinking through (and discussing with your team if possible) your application’s major features. I suggest arriving at the Sprint 0 planning meeting with an idea of the “epic” User Stories for your application. Review the User Stories included in the proposal for your project (and others).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sprint-0">Sprint “0”</h2>

<p>The focus of Sprint 0 is project setup, planning and design, not coding. At the end of Sprint 0 you should have all of the infrastructure for your team/project setup, an initial set of “epic” User Stories and an initial set of “lo-fi” sketches of your application design.</p>

<h3 id="before-the-first-sprint-planning-meeting">Before the First Sprint Planning Meeting</h3>

<p>As an individual complete the getting started tasks listed above under <a href="#getting-started">“Getting Started”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="agenda-for-the-first-sprint-planning-meeting">Agenda for the First Sprint Planning Meeting</h3>

<p>You have a lot to accomplish in your first formal meeting, including initializing your repository and other tools so that you can begin development in Sprint 1, defining the initial features of your application, and starting the design process.</p>

<h4 id="administrative-tasks">Administrative Tasks</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select your Product Owner and your first Scrum Facilitator</p>

    <p>As a team select your <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-po">Product Owner</a> and the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm">Scrum Facilitator (Scrum Master)</a> for the first <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-sprint">Sprint</a>.  The former may be the proposer, but need not be. If you have an external customer, the Product Owner will be the primary interface between the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-dev">Development Team</a> and Customer. In between group meetings with the customer, the Produce Owner will be the single point-of-contact to ensure efficient and effective communication. In our implementation of Scrum, the Development Team will play a bigger role in managing the Product Backlog than is described in the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog">Scrum Guide</a>. Recall that the Scrum Facilitator is not the leader of the team but instead is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process. The Development team, and only the development team, is responsible for determining how to turn the Product Backlog into working software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setup a way to communicate as a team</p>

    <p>You could use Slack, Discord, group messaging, e-mail, or whatever tool(s) are most effective for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setup your <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog">Product Backlog</a></p>

    <p>We will use GitHub <a href="https://github.com/features/project-management/">project management features</a> to maintain the product backlog and sprint backlog(s). Check out this minimal <a href="https://github.com/orgs/csci312-common-v2/projects/1">example</a> for the “in-class” application. Each “item” can have text, images, etc. The GitHub “project” is linked to your repository and the items become issues in your GitHub repository that you can also reference in commits, etc. The key fields you need are “status” (to indicate if the item is an “epic”, in the product backlog, sprint backlog, or completed in a given sprint) and size (one of 1, 2, 4, or 8). Priority can be indicated by the relative position in the board column (you can drag up items up and down). Note you will need to tweak the default setup for the GitHub project. You are welcome and encouraged to add additional fields if that is helpful to your team.</p>

    <p>As is often the case in this course, there are many tools we could use for project management and some of those may be “better” than GitHub. However, we are going to standardize on GitHub to reduce the overall logistical complexity and ensure a consistent workflow across the class.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="initial-epic-user-stories-and-storyboards">Initial “Epic” User Stories and Storyboards</h4>

<p>Recall that agile methods discourage extensive up-front design. But you still need to identify the problems your applications should solve and sketch out the major features. Begin your first meeting by defining and prioritizing some of the “epic” User Stories for your application, i.e., the major features. If you have an external customer, you should be defining these users stories in collaboration with your customer. Concurrently begin your lo-fi prototyping. Start drawing simple storyboards for how the stakeholders in your User Stories will interact with your application. Discuss these storyboards with your customer.</p>

<p>At the end of this phase of the meeting you should begin to populate your Product Backlog with an initial set of User Stories. While the “epic” User Stories should describe major functionality, you will need to turn those large features into multiple smaller user stories that can be implemented within a single sprint. That is your Product Backlog should be an “expansion” of your epic User Stories into more manageable increments.</p>

<p>Resist the temptation to deeply brainstorm all aspects of your application. Recall the Mona Lisa example and our <a href="https://jpattonassociates.com/dont_know_what_i_want/">“Iterative Incremental” approach</a>. Brainstorm “wide but shallow” to define the broader problem your application will solve (e.g. “woman in a pastoral setting”) and how you will generally implement that solution (e.g. the “line” drawing). But initially focus most of your attention, i.e., brainstorm “deeply”, on the core feature(s) of your application (i.e. the face of the Mona Lisa).</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to create (epic) User Stories for all your ideas. Creating a user story is not a contract, you will modify and prioritize these backlogs as you go. The moment where you commit is when you select a user story from the product backlog for the sprint backlog, i.e., plan to implement that feature in the current sprint.</p>

<h4 id="defining-nouns-verbs-and-views">Defining Nouns, Verbs and Views</h4>

<p>As you refine the User Stories, begin to create <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/lectures/crc-cards.html">CRC cards</a> for the nouns and verbs in the stories. Look back through your User Stories. The subject and objects of your User Stories are good candidates to become nouns. The nouns will be become the Models in your application and the verbs will often become routes in your server (Controller) or actions in your React components.</p>

<p>Using your lo-fi prototypes, break your Views into React components. As you refine the design for each item, update the backlog items with the additional information (e.g. attach pictures of the storyboards, CRC cards, etc.). Each item in the backlog should eventually have all the information needed for development.</p>

<h4 id="team-workflow">Team Workflow</h4>

<p>You should also take a moment to think about how you want to approach development as a team. Make an initial plan about how much of the work will be done using pair programming, how many sets of eyes need to review pull requests (at least 1), how your team is going to communicate, etc.</p>

<h3 id="project-setup-or-sprint-0-deliverables">Project Setup or “Sprint 0” Deliverables</h3>

<p>As a group complete the setup and design checklists below (as a group does not mean that all members need to be physically present, just that all of the steps have been completed for your project). As an individual complete the setup checklist below. Note that you need to complete some group setup tasks first.</p>

<h4 id="group-checklist-for-the-project-setup">Group Checklist for the Project Setup</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Your project repository has been created in the class GitHub organization and all team members are part of the GitHub team for your project (created by GitHub classroom). That is everyone has completed the <a href="#getting-started-before-the-first-spring-planning-meeting">Getting Started</a> instructions above.</li>
  <li>The GitHub classroom assignment initializes your project with a <a href="https://github.com/csci312a-f23/project-skeleton">skeleton</a>. Update the <code>package.json</code> file(s) with the project
name, a project description, contributors, repository, etc.</li>
  <li>You have setup a “GitHub” project to manage your product backlog and spring backlog. Any team member should be able to go the project page to find the next most important feature (user story) to work on and any designs or other information they need to implement that feature.</li>
  <li>All team members can successfully clone the repository and run the project in their development environment.</li>
  <li><code>💻 npm test</code> and <code>💻 npm run lint</code> execute without error for all project components, even if there are no actual tests.</li>
  <li>The project repository is successfully integrated with GitHub Actions for CI, i.e., Github actions tests all components of the project and reports “build: passing”.</li>
  <li>The skeleton is deployed to csci312.dev or an alternative public facing platform. Any team member who will deploy needs to complete the pre-requisites, only one team member actually needs to deploy. You can read more about deployment in class <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/resources/deployment.html">here</a>.
    <ol>
      <li>As a prerequisite, all developers should have added an SSH key to GitHub. Doing so is necessary to obtain deploy permissions. Add the deployment repository as a remote in your repository: <code>💻 git remote add deploy git@csci312.dev:&lt;project name&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>💻 git remote add deploy git@csci312.dev:simplepedia</code>. Note that <code>&lt;project name&gt;</code> is the mountain name assigned to your group, e.g., “mansfield”.</li>
      <li>Push the <code>main</code> branch to the deploy repository: <code>💻 git push deploy main</code>. This should automatically build and deploy your application at <code>https://&lt;project name&gt;.csci312.dev</code>. Any errors should hopefully be reported on in the terminal as the push proceeds.</li>
      <li>If you (later) need to add entries to the <code>.env.local</code> file, you can do so with <code>💻 ssh git@csci312.dev secrets &lt;project name&gt; KEY=value</code>, where again <code>&lt;project name&gt;</code> is the name assigned to your group. <code>KEY=value</code> is the value you want to add or update in the file (without any spaces).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The top-level <code>README.md</code> has been updated with the following:
    <ol>
      <li>A <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge">GitHub actions workflow status badge</a> showing build status for the main branch (should be “build: passing”)</li>
      <li>A brief explanation of the need your application addresses</li>
      <li>A link to the deployed application</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Have integrated at least one Pull Request (for example creating the deployment files and updating the README) in which one teammate creates the PR and another teammate reviews the PR.</li>
  <li>A commit tagged “sprint0” pushed to GitHub marking the completion of the project setup, You can tag the last commit as “sprint0” with <code>💻 git tag sprint0</code>. When you push to GitHub use the <code>--tags</code> option to ensure that your tags are pushed as well, e.g. <code>💻 git push origin main --tags</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="group-checklist-for-sprint-0-design-review">Group Checklist for Sprint 0 Design Review</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Populate your GitHub project with your “epic” User Stories, that is the main features your application will implement. These User Stories should be in Connextra format, e.g. “As a [stakeholder], I want to...” and satisfy the INVEST criteria. Begin translating those epic User Stories into more specific manageable user stories in your Product Backlog.</li>
  <li>Create a set of lo-fi storyboards for the main views in your application. These storyboards should show what will become the main React components in your application. The storyboards should be attached to the relevant backlog items.</li>
  <li>Create <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/lectures/crc-cards.html">CRC cards</a> for main “nouns” in your system. The nouns will be become the Models in your application and the verbs will often become routes in your server (Controller) or actions in your React components. Images or transcriptions of the CRC cards should be attached to backlog items for the server side of your application (not all backlog items will necessarily be User Stories).</li>
</ol>

<p>The instructor(s) will provide feedback on your initial design approach as you start Sprint 1 to help your team get headed in a good direction.</p>

<h4 id="individual-checklist-for-the-project-setup">Individual Checklist for the Project Setup</h4>

<p>As an individual make sure you that you can successfully run the project in your development environment.</p>

<h2 id="sprint-1">Sprint “1+”</h2>

<h3 id="sprint-planning-meeting">Sprint Planning Meeting</h3>

<p>Each sprint will start with a <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning">planning meeting</a> where you the answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the goal of this sprint, i.e. what backlog items can be delivered in this sprint?</li>
  <li>How will you complete the work to implement your sprint goal(s)?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="setting-the-sprint-goal">Setting the Sprint Goal</h4>

<p>Choose a subset of your highest priority items from the Product Backlog as your Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal (or <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-sprintbacklog">Sprint Backlog</a>) is the set of functionality that you will implement during the Sprint. Accurately scoping the Sprint Goal depends on knowing how much work each story will require and your team’s capability (velocity). Both will be difficult to estimate at first. Thus be prepared to adjust your Sprint Backlog as you begin to determine out how you will implement the items you have chosen for your Sprint Goal.</p>

<p>I encourage you to not ignore the server in your early work, although you may find it easier to get started by implementing only a minimal memory-backed server (recall from the practical that you can build a very useful server using in-memory data structures instead of a database). I would suggest postponing “necessary evils”, such as user authentication (not the User model, just the authentication) that we will discuss later in the semester, to subsequent Sprints.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-you-implement-the-sprint-goal">How Will You Implement the Sprint Goal?</h4>

<p>Begin designing the features you selected for your Sprint Goal. As you do so, aim to break complex User Stories down to smaller User Stories (on the order of a single day’s coding effort) and their corresponding Scenarios. Your goal is to be able estimate the Story Points for each item in the Sprint Backlog. Each item, and its corresponding point value, should be entered into your team’s backlog tracking tool.</p>

<p>As you refine the User Stories, begin to create or update existing <a href="/~mlinderman/courses/cs312/f23/lectures/crc-cards.html">CRC cards</a> for the nouns in the stories. Using your lo-fi storyboards, break your Views into React components. As you refine the design for each item, update the tracker with the additional information (e.g. attach pictures of the storyboards, CRC cards, etc.). Each item in the backlog should have all the information need for development.</p>

<p>As you get deeper into the design process, you will likely find it helpful to begin to take ownership of different stories and split into smaller sub-groups to work on those specific items.</p>

<p>At the end of the meeting, you should have defined your Sprint Goal and have an initial design for those features of your application. Each team member should have taken responsibility for one or more items from the backlog.</p>

<h3 id="sprint-1-completion-checklist">Sprint “1+” Completion Checklist</h3>

<p>At the end of each sprint your team should complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A tagged commit on main (one of “sprint1”, “sprint2”, or “sprint3”) pushed to GitHub marking the completion of the sprint.</li>
  <li>A set of closed User Stories or other work items in your sprint backlog tracker assigned to that sprint iteration.</li>
  <li>Working deployment of the tagged commit demonstrating the completed User Stories.</li>
  <li>The GitHub Actions CI build for your tagged commit is passing.</li>
  <li>Each team member has completed the confidential self- and peer-evaluation <a href="#">survey</a> (<strong>due 24 hours after the Sprint Retrospective</strong>).</li>
  <li>A short in-class demo showing the features that you completed in that sprint.</li>
</ol>

<p>The demo is a short (no more than 4 minutes) presentation demonstrating the just-completed features of your application. There are no slides, instead you will demonstrate your software live while describing the relevant user stories. The goal is to elicit feedback from your classmates and or customer (if relevant). The demonstration should run from your deployed application not a local development setup. Since the demo is so short, only 2-3 team members need to present (but it does need to be a different set of team members for each sprint).</p>

<h3 id="sprint-retrospective">Sprint Retrospective</h3>

<p>Immediately after the demonstrations, each team will conduct a <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro">Sprint Retrospective</a>. The Retrospective is “an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.” Ask yourself what aspects of your development process and tools worked well and which could be improved (those need not be mutually exclusive lists). At the conclusion of the Retrospective your team should have identified improvements that you will implement in the next Sprint. <em>Make sure to keep a record of your discussion and any improvements you plan to make.</em> The outcomes of your Sprint Retrospectives will be part of final project report.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-the-project-deliverables">End of the Project Deliverables</h2>

<p>The checklist for the end of the project is largely a superset of the “Sprint 1+” deliverables.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A commit tagged “sprint3” on main pushed to GitHub marking the completion of the sprint (and project).</li>
  <li>A set of User Stories or other work items in your sprint backlog tracker assigned to sprint 3 marked as “done”.</li>
  <li>Working deployment of the tagged commit demonstrating you application (there should be a valid link in the README of your repository to your deployment so we can find it).</li>
  <li>The Github Actions CI build for your tagged commit is passing (“green”).</li>
  <li>Each team member has completed the confidential self- and peer-evaluation <a href="#">survey</a> (<strong>due TBD at 4:15PM</strong>).</li>
  <li>Final checkpoint (a checklist, detailed below, to ensure that your project could be handed-off to another team).</li>
  <li>Instead of a short demo, you will give a longer final technical presentation.</li>
  <li>A short write-up <em>as a team</em> summarizing the project submitted to <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> (details below).</li>
  <li>A short write-up <em>as an individual</em> summarizing your contributions to and experience working on the project submitted to <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> (details below).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="final-checkpoint">Final checkpoint</h4>

<p>The final checkpoint is intended to ensure that your project could be “handed off” to a future team for enhancements and maintenance, that is a future CS312 group could get your application “up and running” in both a development and production environment without your help.</p>

<p>Make sure the following is true for your application <em>on the main branch when starting from a fresh clone of your repository</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can successfully install all dependencies with <code>💻 npm install</code>.</li>
  <li>Executing <code>💻 npm run dev</code> in the top-level directory successfully starts the application in the development environment. If any additional steps are needed to the run the application in development (e.g. starting a database, migrating and seeding the database, etc.) document those steps (including any commands) in your <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>All tests and linting pass, i.e. the following commands do not give errors (should be true if your CI build passing):</p>

    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">💻 npm test
💻 npm run lint
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Your application can be deployed. All necessary deployment steps should be documented, including any environment variables that must be set, database migrations, etc. In the case of “secret” (or not-secret) environment variables, note that such variables are needed and send an example <code>.env.local</code> file to the instructors (don’t include those secrets in your README). For example, “the ‘AwesomeApp’ requires a Google Maps API key and a Google authentication client ID”. Any other information needed to use the application in production, such as an “admin” password, should be similarly documented.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, using just the information in your <code>README.md</code> file and any <code>.env.local</code> file you send to the instructor(s), we should be able to successfully develop and deploy your application starting from a fresh clone of your repository.</p>

<h4 id="final-technical-demo">Final Technical Demo</h4>

<p>At the end of the semester you will give a 10-15 minute technical presentation about your project. Your presentation should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A demonstration of your <strong>deployed</strong> project. Your demo should include a walk-through of the features from a user perspective(s) as well as a description of any important back-end functionality you implemented (e.g. specialized algorithms, interesting technologies you utilized).</li>
  <li>A discussion of the major challenges you faced. These can be both technical as well as challenges of working in a (large) team.</li>
  <li>Comment on your scrum process, including:
    <ul>
      <li>What was your final velocity? Did it change over time?</li>
      <li>What changes did you make to your development process based on your Sprint Retrospectives?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With the benefit of hindsight, what, if anything, would you have done differently? What lessons did you learn? Again these can be technical (e.g., we would have designed our application differently) or process-focused.</li>
  <li>Future work: What is left to be completed to get to “version 1.0” of your project? What will happen to your application in the future?</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not expect that everyone will be present or that everyone will actually be a presenter. However everyone is expected to contribute to creating and refining the presentation. If you are not present make sure that you are equivalently contributing to your team in other ways.</p>

<p>We expect your presentation will have three “main” sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An introduction, likely using slides, which briefly describes the problem you are solving and provides any background the audience needs to understand your application. For example: Who are your users? What constraints were imposed on your design (by your customer, the College, etc.)?</li>
  <li>The demonstration. Your demonstration should be organized and polished. Make a plan for how you will show all the features you have implemented, and what you will say about each. If there is a natural “story” to how users will interact with your application, i.e. first they do ‘X’ then ‘Y’, try to organize your demo around those stories. Some features, e.g. back-end features may not be amenable to demonstration, and instead may be best described with slides.</li>
  <li>A description of the process, also likely using slides. Address the questions the above. One of the goals for this portion of the presentation is learn from our classmates experience. I suspect that there will be some common themes, but also unique challenges and solutions that we can all learn from.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="final-team-write-up">Final Team Write-up</h4>

<p>As a team, submit a three-page (max) write-up to Gradescope summarizing your project. The report must discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What was the original project plan/goal? How much of that plan did you accomplish?</li>
  <li>What were some of the challenges in implementing the project?</li>
  <li>What were some of the challenges/benefits of the Scrum process from your teams’ perspective?</li>
  <li>What changes did you make to your development process based on your Sprint Retrospectives?</li>
  <li>What was your team’s “velocity” by the end? Specifically, how much work could your team accomplish during a sprint (state this in whatever terms you were using to score User Story difficulty). Was this consistent over the sprints?</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, we should be able to see in GitHub the User Stories/work items and estimated difficulty that you assigned to each Sprint Goal (i.e. what you planned to do for that sprint) and which items were completed by the end of the Sprint (i.e. what you accomplished during the sprint). In an Appendix (which does not count towards your page limit), describe how to find the above information in your tracker (i.e. how Sprint goals are tagged, how “done” is indicated, etc.). If the above information is not available in your tracker, please include it in a table in the Appendix.</p>

<p>We expect that there will be substantial overlap between the final presentation and write-up. That is intended. Think of the write-up as the “take home” accompaniment to your presentation.</p>

<p>Only one group member needs to submit your write-up to Gradescope. When they do so, the submitter should add their group members as shown <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-student-group-members">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="final-individual-write-up">Final Individual Write-up</h4>

<p>As an individual, submit a 1.5-page (max) summary to Gradescope of your overall contributions to and experiences working on the project. Your report must discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What were your overall contributions to the project? Certainly use your backlog tracker, GitHub, etc. for reference, but this should be a high-level summary.</li>
  <li>Describe your role(s) in the team.</li>
  <li>What were some of the challenges you encountered while working on the project?</li>
  <li>What were some aspects of project to which you think you were a particularly valuable contributor? These could be technical and/or team/process-focused.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-evaluation">Project Evaluation</h2>

<p>The rubric for the project evaluation will be developed with you as a class and your specific team as the project begins and evolves. Note that unlike our programming assignments there isn’t a pre-determined goal, but instead you as a team are defining the “face” of your Mona Lisa. Your project is primarily evaluated on your demonstration of effective development processes, not the end result. However, effective development processes lead to deploying working and maintainable code, i.e., a process that doesn’t produce a deployed application is by definition not effective.</p>

<p>Each project sprint you will receive feedback based on the following metrics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The deliverables described above</li>
  <li>User stories: User stores are INVESTable, cover the work done over the sprint and include relevant supporting information, e.g., lo-fi design sketches, CRC cards, where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Agility/scrum: Agility will be demonstrated through a consistent pattern of commits, use of scores to keep track of velocity, and good use of the backlog.</li>
  <li>Integration: Your team uses feature branches and pull requests to move your project forward. Pull requests are reviewed before merging into main, and pull requests with failing tests are not merged.</li>
  <li>Implementation: The code you produce should be maintainable (i.e., represents “strategic programming”) and supported with tests.</li>
  <li>Functionality: The project actually does what was promised by the end of the sprint.</li>
</ol>

<p>These metrics will be considered for the project as well as for individuals. To facilitate tracking contributions when Pair Programming, use GitHub’s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/">co-authoring feature</a>. Add the following line to the end of your commit message (after a blank line):</p>

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Co-authored-by: name &lt;name@example.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The key information is the e-mail address, which must be the e-mail address associated with the person’s GitHub account. Each commit can have multiple co-authors.</p>

<h2 id="project-faq">Project FAQ</h2>

<h4 id="are-there-any-technologies-we-cant-use">Are there any technologies we can’t use?</h4>

<p>You are welcome (and encouraged) to use any of the technologies we have worked with in class (and libraries for those technologies, e.g. various React libraries). Outside of those technologies, please check in with the instructor(s).</p>

<h4 id="can-we-deploy-to-an-alternate-platforms">Can we deploy to an alternate platforms?</h4>

<p>Yes! The key requirement is that your project is deployed and publicly available (i.e., not just running in development mode on your personal computer). You are welcome to use any platform that meets those requirements. That said only the “official” approach described above is the one that will be supported.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-i-ensure-my-project-is-not-successful-project-anti-patterns">How can I ensure my project is not successful? Project anti-patterns...</h4>

<p>In past years we have observed a number of anti-patterns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large backlog items. The large scope leads to difficult merges. And large items are incompatible with pair programming. You will not have enough schedule overlap to complete work.</li>
  <li>Long-lived branches. The projects move quickly and branches with partially completed features quickly get out of date. Don’t let a feature sit partially completed. Aim for backlog items that can be completed in a few days at most.</li>
  <li>Tactical vs. strategic programming, i.e., prioritizing writing as much code as quickly as possible without consideration of the future. The resulting complexity often boxes teams in for the rest of the project.</li>
  <li>Put off the server-side functionality. Don’t put off the server/database, implement a skeleton of your server and initial model in sprint 1 to have template to guide subsequent development.</li>
  <li>Don’t use your CRC cards to hash out your model representations.</li>
  <li>Ignore the code your teammates are writing if it is not a feature you are working on.</li>
  <li>Only test your production deployment at the last minute. You should be deploying regularly such that doing so is routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I encourage you to revisit the “Advice from CS169” slides sprinkled throughout our lectures. Those very relevant suggestions are sourced from undergraduate students in a similar class, implementing very similar projects.</p>
