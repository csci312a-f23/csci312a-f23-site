            <h1 id="interesting-project-questions">Interesting Project Questions</h1>

<p>As we get deeper into the projects, and thus deeper into our tools (e.g.
React), multiple groups have encountered tricky technical questions. I have
gathered some of those questions here along with general advice as we use our
tools in more sophisticated ways.</p>

<h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3>

<h4 id="taking-advantage-of-the-model-associations-in-objectionjs-or-making-the-tools-work-for-you">Taking advantage of the model associations in Objection,js, or making the tools work for you</h4>

<p>Often we want all of the data contained in a model <em>and</em> its associated models.
Think back to our Film Explorer example. If we are populating a User’s profile
page we want to show them all the movies they have rated. That is we would
ultimately want to construct an object like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  id: 11,
  username: "filmfan",
  ...
  ratings: [
    { userId: 11, filmId: 12, rating: 4},
    ...
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>We could construct that result by querying <code>/api/users/11</code> on the client,
followed perhaps by a query to <code>/api/users/11/ratings</code> (or worse, by sending a
request to <code>/api/ratings</code> and filtering on the client), but a better approach
is to use Objection.js knowledge the relations to “eagerly” query for a model
<em>and</em> all of it associated data. Check out the <a href="lecture11s20-rdbms.pdf">RDBMS
slides</a> and the <a href="http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading">Objection.js
guide</a>.
We should be able to fetch all of the data above with a single sequence of
Objection.js methods, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">User.query().findById().withGraphFetched('Ratings')
</code></pre>

<p>The above does require that we have specified the associations in our
Objections.js models. But once we have that in place, Objection.js can do a lot
of the work of constructing objects for us across multiple tables (that is what
Object Relational Mapping is about, mapping database relations to objects).
More generally, we want the libraries do as much of the work for us as
possible.</p>

<p>Note that are not limited to just one database operation in each route or to
directly sending the data from the query to the client. The server routes are
just JavaScript code and so we can perform any modifications we need in the
route to generate the desired response.</p>

<h4 id="migrations-are-stateful">Migrations are stateful</h4>

<p>Note that migration filenames contain a date and time:</p>

<pre><code>migrations/20190424165216_users_and_articles.js
</code></pre>

<p>Knex (and other similar tools) apply migrations in date-time order and track
the last migration applied. Thus applying the same migrations multiple times
won’t have any effect and modifying a migration that has already been applied
won’t have any effect.</p>

<p>Why does it work this way? The intended use for migrations is evolving a
database that is in use, i.e. has customer data that you don’t want to lose.
Thus we don’t want to “double apply” the changes in a migration. And there
isn’t the expectation that we would go back and modify already implied
migrations because that would invalidate the data.</p>

<p>Modifying a migration is common during development. If you do so, either delete
the database and rebuild from scratch (easy with SQLite, less so with other
databases) or more robustly, rollback all the migrations (invoking the “down”
operations) then reapply.</p>

<h4 id="objectionjs-model-validations-run-before-data-is-inserted-into-the-database">Objection.js model validations run before data is inserted into the database</h4>

<p>Since Objection.js model validations run before data is inserted into the
database, you don’t want to make any fields created by the database, such as an
auto-incrementing primary key, required. Any attempt to create an object,
such as in a “POST” request, without that id will fail validation. Note that
the <a href="https://github.com/csci312-common/example-film-explorer">FilmExplorer</a>
example makes the <code>id</code> required because all of the data came with <code>id</code>
preassigned and there is no route for creating new film entries.</p>

<h3 id="react">React</h3>

<h4 id="useeffect-dependencies-and-infinite-loops"><code>useEffect</code> dependencies (and infinite loops)</h4>

<p>We use the <code>useEffect</code> when we want to perform an operation such as setting
state (or fetching data) in our render function. Recall that <code>useEffect</code> can
take two arguments, the effect function and an array of dependencies. Many of
times we have employed <code>useEffect</code> we set the dependencies to be the empty
array; this specifies that the effect should be run only once when the
component is first mounted on the webpage. That is appropriate for fetching the
initial data or other similar tasks. But we can also specify dependencies that
ensure the hook executes whenever one of its inputs change - and only when an
input changes.</p>

<p>We need to make sure that all the dependencies are specified. Doing so
correctly and efficiently can be subtle. Some values, e.g. the setters returned
by the <code>useState</code> <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate">hook don’t change and so can be
omitted</a> from the
<code>useEffect</code> dependency list. Other values may change to much cause our hook to
execute to frequently, or even cause an infinite loop. For example, callbacks.
Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>function Example(props) {
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    props.callback(...);
  }, [props.callback]);
  return ...;
}

function Parent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);
  return (
    &lt;Example callback={(value) =&gt; setState(value)} /&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The hook correctly specifies the callback as dependency. However, the hook will
end up executing more frequently than we want. That callback function is
re-created in every render of the parent and thus appears to have changed on
every render, trigger the effect on every render, triggering the callback on
every render, which perhaps triggers a re-render ... We instead want to provide a
more stable callback. We could do so by just using the setter as the callback
(e.g. <code>callback={setState}</code>) since it is stable or use the <code>useCallback</code> hook
to create a stable callback (check out this
<a href="https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/">guide</a> at the section
that starts “The same solution works for function props passed from parents”.</p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<h4 id="merge-conflicts-happen">Merge conflicts happen</h4>

<p>As you write more code I suspect you are running into more merge conflicts.
The best way to minimize merge conflicts is to make branches short-lived and
integrate frequently. But even with very frequent integrations you will still
run into merge conflicts. Check out the <a href="lecture09s20-agile.pdf">slides</a> and
this
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts">guide</a>
for an introduction for working through merge conflicts. Keep in mind that what
you are doing is indicating to Git the correct output for integrating two sets
of changes. So you want to review every conflict and edit the file into the
desired output state. Sometimes that means picking one of the two versions, but
more often it means manually combining the code from the two versions.</p>
