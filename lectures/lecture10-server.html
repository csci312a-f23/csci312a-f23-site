            <h1 id="implementing-the-rest-api">Implementing the REST API</h1>

<p>We are going to implement our server in Node. There is no requirement we do so.
Since we are using HTTP as the interface any system that provides a HTTP server
would do. We will use Node in this role so that we can use the same programming
language on the server as we do on the client. In particular we will use
Express, a simple server framework for implementing our routes.</p>

<p>Why use Node in this role? Node is not just a JavaScript interpreter. It
implements an asynchronous event loop focused on I/O operations and series of
modules for interacting with the file system, HTTP, DNS, etc... Like the
browser, Node is single threaded, but achieves high throughput by maintaining
high utilization. Long latency operations are asynchronous so that the main
thread can continue with other work. This architecture does mean that
computationally intensive operations can monopolize the main thread (the same
can happen in the browser).</p>

<h2 id="simple-node-server">Simple Node Server</h2>

<p>Creating a HTTP server with Node is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((request, response) =&gt; {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  response.end("Don't Panic");
}).listen(5042);
console.log( 'Listening on port %d', server.address().port );
</code></pre>

<p><code>createServer</code> launches a HTTP server and invokes the supplied handler on any
request. Note that here we ignore the request and always return the same
response.</p>

<p>With this low-level interface we are responsible for everything: interpreting
the request and building the entire response. As you expect there is an
opportunity for frameworks that implement the common features of a web server.
We will use <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>, a “minimalist” routing oriented
framework. There is a counterpart to Express in most server-side languages
(e.g. Sinatra for Ruby and Flask for Python).</p>

<h2 id="express">Express</h2>

<p>Recall two key constraints of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>: uniform
interface (of method and URI), and layered systems. In Express, these are
reflected in the routing oriented interface (a Express application contains
multiple <code>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)</code> routes) and the middleware system. Express
actually “has minimal functionality of its own: an Express application is
essentially a series of middleware function calls”
(<a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html">source</a>).</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-simple-server">Creating a simple server</h3>

<p>A simple <code>index.js</code> implementing an Express server.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (request, response) =&gt; {
  response.send("Don't Panic");
});

const server = http.createServer(app).listen(process.env.PORT || 5042);
console.log('Listening on port %d', server.address().port);
</code></pre>

<p>Express provides <code>response.send</code>, which automatically sends the headers, sets
the correct content type, and calls <code>end()</code> (so it will only be called once
during a response). It will even convert JavaScript objects to JSON for us!
Note the route-centric interface with the handler for GET “/”.</p>

<p>We can easily add additional routes, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get('/about', (request, response) =&gt; {
  response.send('A simple server that does nothing at all');
});
</code></pre>

<h3 id="middleware">Middleware</h3>

<p>We can extend our server with middleware to add functionality. For example, we
will need to parse the JSON data sent to the server. We can add middleware to
do so automatically.</p>

<p>First we install the package <code>npm install --save body-parser</code>, then incorporate
the middleware:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
...
app.use(bodyParser.json());
</code></pre>

<p>The middleware will automatically parse JSON request bodies and update the
<code>request.body</code> property.</p>

<p>Another common middleware is <code>express.static</code> which serves static files (e.g.
HTML files, CSS, etc.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.use(express.static('/path/to/folder/of/static/assets'));
</code></pre>

<p>We would use that middleware to efficiently serve the static assets created in
a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#npm-run-build-or-yarn-build">production build of
CRA</a>.
In the Film Explorer servers you will notice a recurring pattern in which the
static middleware is used to serve assets like <code>index.html</code> when running in
production mode.</p>

<h3 id="middleware-as-a-design-pattern-and-aspect-oriented-programming">Middleware as a design pattern (and Aspect Oriented Programming)</h3>

<p>The Express middleware is an example of a design pattern for implementing
“cross cutting” concerns. Each middleware has access to the request, the
response and the next middleware in the chain. Invoking <code>send</code> terminates the
chain (and sends a response), while calling <code>next()</code> passes the request (and
response) objects to the next middleware in the chain. With the middleware
pattern we build up a complex application from many small transformations to
the request (or response).</p>

<p>Moreover those transformations aren’t applied to a single request (as in the
request handlers above), but many different kinds of requests (hence “cross
cutting concerns”). For example, in many applications most routes require the
user to login. Instead of introducing this check in each route, we can do so
with a middleware that will redirect all but a few specific un-authenticated
requests to the login page.</p>

<p>“Cross cutting” concerns are those that affect many parts (or concerns) of a
program not just one. Aspect Oriented Programming is a set of techniques to
implement these “cross cutting” concerns while maintaining modularity and
maintainability. We will see other examples of “cross cutting” concerns soon,
notably in implementing validations for models (in the MVC sense).</p>

<h3 id="parameterized-routes">Parameterized Routes</h3>

<p>We can parameterize the routes to extract resource IDs. Here are two example
routes from Film Explorer. The colon indicates a parameter and those parameters
can be accessed in the <code>request.params</code> object.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get('/api/films', (request, response) =&gt; {
  response.send(Array.from(films.values()));
});

app.put('/api/films/:id', (request, response) =&gt; {
  const filmId = parseInt(request.params.id, 10);
  const newFilm = request.body;
  const mergedFilm = Object.assign({}, films.get(filmId), newFilm);
  movies.set(mergedFilm.id, mergedFilm);
  response.send(mergedFilm);
});
</code></pre>

<p>These callbacks implement the routes we described last time, i.e. there is a
one-to-one mapping between the API and these handlers.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-model-in-model-view-controller-servers-in-action">What about the Model in Model-View-Controller Servers in action</h2>

<p>The Express routes often function as the controller (in the MVC sense). What
about the Model? In this context, the model is a movie. There is no explicit
model class, just a JavaScript object. And for such a simple application in
which we are not persisting any changes (that is ratings don’t persist through
restarting the server), we might not need much more. But as we want to add
features, we will quickly find that we could benefit from established design
patterns and library support.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How will we validate that a user’s rating is between 0-5? Our client
application restricts users to that range, but recall that the server exposes
an API that can be used by others, not just our client. Anyone can make a PUT
request (including by using JavaScript to modify the client application state),
thus validation on the client alone is not (never) sufficient and we will also
need to validate inputs on the server to ensure data integrity. This is
important: <strong>Never trust the client (not even yours)!</strong>. We can typically
implement verification with a combination of schemas, which specify the types
of properties in the model, and custom validation functions.</li>
  <li>How will we express associations between models (in a way that facilitates
queries and updates). For example, a films can have many genres. Or in the
future we can imagine a multi-user version of this application in which there
are now multiple models: Users, Films and Ratings. Each user could have their
own rating for a movie.</li>
  <li>Our application may use different persistence tiers, i.e. different databases
(SQLite3 in development, PostgreSQL in production). We would like our models to
abstract away those differences.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object-relational Mapping
(ORM)</a> libraries
provide much of the above “cross-cutting” (or aspect oriented) functionality
(the parts that are the same) and thus we will often use ORM libraries to
implement our models. The choice of a specific library will often depend on
what kind of database we plan to use (e.g. SQL vs. NoSQL). We will discuss
those choices more in subsequent classes. For now we will focus on the data
modeling itself.</p>

<h3 id="crc-and-uml">CRC and UML</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">Class Responsibility Cards
(CRC)</a>
are like User Stories but for classes. Each index card contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On top of the card, the class name</li>
  <li>On the left, the responsibilities of the class, i.e. what this class “knows”
and “does”. For example, a “car” class may know how many seats and doors it
has, and could “do” things like stop and go.</li>
  <li>On the right, the collaborators (other classes) with which this class
interacts to fulfill its responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Like User Stories, using an index card limits complexity and helps designers focus on the essentials of the system. We have put together <a href="crc-cards.html">an example</a> of using CRC cards to specify some aspects of FilmExplorer.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modeling Language (UML)</a> is an older and more formalized approach to describing all of the artifacts in an object-oriented system. The UML specification is quite large, and we won’t delve into it. however, it is certainly a widely used technique, and its diagraming features for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">modeling classes and their relationships</a> may provide you with additional ways to think about how to model the objects in your system.</p>
